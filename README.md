Machine Learning Projects â€“ Python & Jupyter Notebooks
This repository contains various machine learning projects built using Python in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb). It serves as a collection of practical implementations of machine learning algorithms, data analysis techniques, and model-building workflows.

More projects will be added regularly to cover a wide range of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning techniques.
